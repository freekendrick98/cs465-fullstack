Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

This project used express HTML, JavaScript, and SPA to bring together a website for the customer to use. The express html was the backend of the website while the SPA was the admin front end.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

We used a No SQL database simply because it is easier to navigate and to push and pull from. Also, MongoDB will work without a exterior app as it only needs those to be tested.

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is what helps tell data where to go whie Javascript is what moves it. The Javascript is the hard code that can contain functions while JSON cannot.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Often code was refractored to save space and redundancy. This was done with the add-trips, trips-listiing, edit-trip, and delete trip. Rather than make everything over and over again I can reference other parts of the project that are applicable to the current sitiation to keep it clean and concise.

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

The methods of request were add, delete, and edit, also referenced to as PUT, PUSH, GET, and DELETE. All of these methods were used through the SPA to alter the MongoDB on the backend. All of the testing for this was done via visual studio code which allowed me to run two terminals at once, a neccesity for this project. Executing commands on the SPA, I would check Postman to see if the data had been pulled or not. If the data had been pulled or pushed, the server terminal would give me a numerical output such as 200(good)or 404(bad).

Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has given me insight into the many kinds of avenues that a full stack developer may have to travel down. I was not familiar with Angular or powershell prior to this course and they will prove to be helpful skill in the future. I can now even embark on my own website creation. As for my marketability, the skills that I have obtained from this course will be invaluable going forward.
